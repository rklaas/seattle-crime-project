# Seattle-Segregated: A School Report
[Link To Shiny Application](https://ianwohlersuw.shinyapps.io/seattle-segregated/)

This report visually shows schools in Seattle in a way that makes it clear where the high and low rated schools are located. We found many common factors that are present within good schools versus bad schools, particularly along racial and geographic divides. The goal of this report is to be a call to action for awareness of the McCleary decision and a tool for activists to clearly demonstrate traces of racism that still exist in Seattle today.
